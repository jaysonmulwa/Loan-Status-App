Deployment Guide


STEP 1 - INSTALLING PostgreSQL, phpPgAdmin AND Apache2
PostgreSQL and PhpPgAdmin are available in the Ubuntu repository. So you just need to install them with the apt command.
	sudo apt-get -y install postgresql postgresql-contrib phppgadmin
The above command will automatically install all packages needed by PostgreSQL, like Apache, PHP etc.


STEP 2 - CONFIGURE PostgreSQL user
PostgreSQL uses role for user authentication and authorization, it just like Unix-Style permissions.
By default, PostgreSQL creates a new user called "postgres" for basic authentication.
To use PostgreSQL, you need to login to the "postgres" account, you can do that by typing:
	sudo su
	su - postgres

Now you can access the PostgreSQL prompt with the command:
	psql

And then change the password for postgres role by typing:
	\password postgres

	ENTER YOUR PASSWORD

Then enter \q to leave the psql command line.

Run the command "exit" to leave the postgres user and become root again.
	exit

	
STEP 3 - CONFIGURE Apache2
You need to configure apache for phpPgAdmin. Edit the file /etc/apache2/conf-available/phppgadmin.conf with nano by typing:
	cd /etc/apache2/conf-available/
	nano phppgadmin.conf

Comment out the line #Require local by adding a # in front of the line and add below the line allow from all so that you can access from your browser.


STEP 4 - CONFIGURE phpPgAdmin
Edit the file /etc/phppgadmin/config.inc.php by typing :
	cd /etc/phppgadmin/
	nano config.inc.php

Find the line $conf['extra_login_security'] = true; and change the value to false so you can login to phpPgAdmin with user postgres.


STEP 5 - RESTART PostgreSQL AND Apache2
	systemctl restart postgresql
	systemctl restart apache2

	
STEP 6 - TESTING
Now access phpPgAdmin with your browser http://your-ip-address/phppgadmin/ e.g 192.168.1.100/phppgadmin
and then try login to with user postgres and your password.

STEP 7 - DEPLOY
Place all the required webapp files from github in the document root for apache.
The default document root for Apache is /var/www/ or /var/www/html depending on the linux version or OS.
Access the files in the browser using http://localhost/filename.html/
